// This file is P3's profile registry: it loads operator-supplied YAML quirk
// profiles from a directory and folds them into the built-in (in-tree) profiles,
// with an explicit, project-derived support tier and a name-first selection seam
// the CLI and fleet server share.
//
// The boundary guarantees from P1/P2 are unchanged: a profile is still inert data
// compiled through the safe Views (it can never set the Image URL, force an
// unsupported ResetType, or touch sessions/TLS/system selection). P3 only adds
// WHERE a profile comes from and HOW it is selected and labelled.

// Tier is the project-derived support level of a quirk profile. A profile never
// asserts its own tier; the registry derives it from where the profile came from
// and whether it carries recorded hardware evidence (a sanitized mockup, added in
// P4). See design §4b.
